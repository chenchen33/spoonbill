#Introduction
Spoonbill is a responsive and content-focused theme. The basic layout of this theme is to put content in the middle and as little distraction as possible. On the index and search page, more information is provided by the sidebar while on the single posts and single pages, sidebar function is provided in the footer for users after they read through the content. Let’s take a look at some basic features of this on-going theme from top to bottom.

#Features
##Customizable Navigation
Primary menu and optional social menu are provided for user. Social menu will display social media icons powered by Font Awesome by detecting the URLs users provide.

##Fixed Nav when Scrolling Down
Navigation bar will be fixed at the top of screen when scrolling down. Because the content-focused style eliminates sidebar on the single page and post, a fixed narrow navigation on top of page will help to provide clear and better navigation.

##Customizable Site Branding
Users can customize site title and description with different background color and text color. Optional branding  image of 1060px x 300px can be displayed below site title and description.

##Large Marquee on Index Page
On index page, a 1060px x 530px large marquee is provided for highlighting purpose.  Marquee size and description is responsive to screen size. Image links are provided if there is a link in the description.

##Featured Image
On single posts and pages, featured images are centered under site branding with a maximum size of 1060px x 424px. On index and search pages, featured images are placed above post indexes with size of 730px x 292px. The image width-height-ratio is 2.5 for easy calculation.

##Highlighting First Post
The first post on the index page, whether it’s a sticky post or most recent post, will display full text while other indexed posts will show a maximum of 100 words before users choose to continue reading.

##Post Formats / Page Formats
Standard and Aside post formats are supported. Asides are displayed without headings or meta content in index pages. All other displays are identical with Standard posts. Two page formats are supported. Page with no sidebar will place content in the middle with maximum width of 800px for easy reading, while gallery page will use full width of site content to display more information from photo.

##Paging and Comments Navigation
On index pages paged navigation is displayed on the bottom posts. On single posts navigation links with the titles of the previous and next posts are displayed. If users choose to page comments at a certain amount, similar comment navigation is provided at the bottom of the comments section.

##Editor Styles
The editor style is developed to ensure the appearance of content in the post and page editors are as close to the live content on the websites as possible.

##External Assets
The theme features three custom fonts:
> * [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) (for main content and sidebar)
> * [PT Serif](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Serif) (for headers)
> * [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) (for icons)
